## The Challenge

Orcania needed a decentralized exchange to facilitate trading of their native OCA token alongside other cryptocurrencies. The challenge was building a multi-chain DEX that could operate on both Ethereum and Boba networks while providing a seamless trading experience.

## System Architecture

I designed a modular smart contract architecture with two core contracts for the DEX platform. The system included automated market maker functionality, liquidity pool management, and comprehensive analytics tracking.

### Smart Contract Infrastructure

**DEX.sol - Core Trading Logic**

The main trading contract implemented a modular architecture with key features:

- Liquidity pool mappings for token pairs
- Token reserve tracking for AMM calculations
- SwapTokens function with automated market maker logic
- Price calculation with slippage protection mechanisms
- Dynamic liquidity pool management

**DEX_DATA.sol - Analytics & State Management**

A dedicated data contract managed trading information:

- TradingPair struct storing token addresses, volume, and prices
- Real-time trading data updates via updateTradingData function
- Historical trading data retrieval via getTradingHistory
- Last updated timestamps for price accuracy tracking
- Multi-chain data synchronization support

### Contract Addresses

The smart contracts were deployed with the following addresses:

**Boba Network (Chain ID: 28)**

- DEX Contract: 0xCdE8C10eE7067Ff50f911d74883130D2799FF35c
- DEX_DATA Contract: 0x8da6b7d6423588d7b5FB8Fd940cD3200ae359E18

**Ethereum Rinkeby (Chain ID: 4)**

- DEX Contract: 0x6f4d72B17bFa9b77269b9cd732dDe84f158AfacD
- DEX_DATA Contract: 0x07b346eB566c28853b5E20dB6A94Ea6284E8cc09

### Multi-Chain Deployment

The DEX was deployed across two networks with independent contract instances:

- Boba Network (Chain ID: 28) for lower transaction costs
- Ethereum Rinkeby (Chain ID: 4) for ecosystem compatibility

## Frontend Development

### React Trading Interface

Built a sophisticated trading interface using Next.js and our custom Celeste-JS SDK with comprehensive features:

**Core Trading Components**

- TokenSelector component for choosing trading pairs
- SwapButton with transaction execution logic
- Real-time balance display and updates
- Connected wallet status indicator
- Transaction history tracking

**Multi-Chain Integration**

Leveraged the useCeleste hook from our SDK to access:

- Smart contract instances dynamically per chain
- User wallet address and connection status
- Current chain ID for network-specific operations
- Web3 provider for blockchain interactions

**State Management Architecture**

Implemented sophisticated Redux architecture for multi-chain state:

- Separate state trees per chain ID
- Liquidity pool tracking across networks
- Real-time price data synchronization
- Transaction status management

### Real-Time Price Calculations

**Automated Market Maker Logic**

Implemented constant product formula (x \* y = k) for price discovery:

- 0.3% trading fee structure
- Input amount calculation with fee deduction
- Output amount calculation maintaining pool ratios
- Slippage protection for market volatility

**Price Feed System**

Real-time updates every 2 seconds for major trading pairs:

- OCA/USDC primary trading pair
- BTC/USDC for Bitcoin exposure
- OCA/BTC for direct crypto swaps
- Volume tracking per pair
- Timestamp-based cache invalidation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Transaction Management

**Robust Error Handling**

Built a comprehensive TransactionManager class with:

- Gas estimation with 20% buffer for reliability
- Optimal gas price calculation based on network conditions
- Transaction confirmation tracking via hash monitoring
- Automatic balance updates post-transaction
- Specific error codes for common failures (INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED)

**User Experience Optimization**

- Loading states during transaction processing
- Success notifications with transaction details
- Error messages with actionable guidance
- Transaction retry mechanisms
- Pending transaction indicators

### Multi-Chain State Management

**Redux Architecture**

Designed sophisticated state management for handling multiple chains:

- SET_CHAIN_DATA action for updating chain-specific information
- UPDATE_LIQUIDITY_POOLS action for pool state synchronization
- Nested state structure with chain ID as primary key
- Immutable state updates using spread operators
- Selector functions for efficient data access

### Security Measures

**Smart Contract Security**

- **Reentrancy Guards**: Implemented OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard pattern
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for administrative functions
- **Slippage Protection**: Maximum slippage limits to prevent MEV attacks
- **Integer Overflow**: SafeMath library for all mathematical operations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking

**Frontend Security**

- Input validation for all user-entered amounts
- Balance verification before transaction submission
- Positive number enforcement for trade amounts
- Email validation patterns where applicable
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

### Performance Optimizations

**Gas Efficiency**

- 25% reduction vs. standard AMM contracts through:
    - Batch operations for multiple swaps
    - Optimized storage patterns
    - Efficient mapping structures
    - Minimal SLOAD/SSTORE operations

**Transaction Speed**

- Average confirmation: 2-5 seconds
- Real-time price accuracy: within 0.1% of market rates
- Instant UI updates via optimistic rendering
- Background balance refresh

### Production Challenges Solved

**Gas Optimization Challenge**

High transaction costs on Ethereum mainnet were addressed by:

- Implementing batch swap operations
- Optimizing smart contract code
- Adding Boba Network support for lower fees

**Price Volatility Challenge**

Rapid price changes causing failed transactions were solved with:

- 2-second price feed updates
- Dynamic slippage calculations
- Transaction queuing system
- MEV attack prevention

**Cross-Chain Consistency Challenge**

Maintaining consistent state across networks achieved through:

- Independent contract deployments per chain
- Chain-specific Redux state management
- Unified API layer abstracting differences
- Network-aware component rendering

## Performance Metrics
