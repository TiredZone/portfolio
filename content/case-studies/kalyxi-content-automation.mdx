## The Challenge

Kalyxi's content team was spending 4+ hours weekly researching trending AI topics, analyzing search data, and managing their content pipeline. The manual process was:

- **Time-Intensive**: Manual research of AI trends and keywords
- **Inconsistent**: No systematic approach to topic selection
- **Disconnected**: Scattered data across multiple platforms
- **Reactive**: Missing trending opportunities due to slow discovery

### Specific Pain Points

- Content managers manually browsing Google Trends for AI keywords
- Unstructured topic brainstorming sessions
- No centralized content pipeline management
- Missed opportunities for trending AI topics
- Manual coordination between content and SEO teams

## The Solution

I developed an intelligent n8n workflow that automates the entire content discovery and pipeline management process using AI-powered analysis.

### Workflow Architecture

**Automated Content Pipeline**

```javascript
// Core trend analysis logic from n8n workflow
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are a content analyst for Kalyxi.

Goal:
Pick EXACTLY 5 NEW blog topics from trend candidates.
- Prefer highest 'trend_score'
- Must be clearly about AI (LLMs, agents, copilots, regulation/safety, chips/infra)
- Exclude generic definitions, celebrity names, non-AI queries
- Do NOT return any topic whose kebab-case slug already appears in existing_slugs
- If fewer than 5 remain, CREATE new topics inspired by trending themes
`;

// Workflow components:
// 1. Schedule Trigger (weekly automation)
// 2. SerpAPI trend monitoring for "AI" keyword (7-day window)
// 3. Google Sheets integration for existing content tracking
// 4. OpenAI topic analysis and selection
// 5. Content brief generation and storage
// 6. Slack notifications for team coordination
```

### Key Features

**1. Intelligent Trend Detection**

- **SerpAPI Integration**: Monitors "AI" keyword trends over 7-day periods
- **Smart Filtering**: Excludes irrelevant queries and focuses on business-relevant AI topics
- **Trend Scoring**: Ranks topics by search volume growth and relevance

**2. AI-Powered Content Analysis**

- **GPT-4 Topic Selection**: Analyzes trend data to select 5 most promising topics
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks against existing content to avoid repetition
- **Content Brief Generation**: Creates detailed outlines for selected topics

**3. Pipeline Management**

- **Google Sheets Integration**: Automatically updates content calendar
- **Status Tracking**: Manages content from ideation through publication
- **Team Coordination**: Real-time Slack notifications for new opportunities

**4. Quality Control**

- **AI Relevance Filtering**: Ensures all topics are genuinely AI-focused
- **Business Value Assessment**: Prioritizes topics with commercial potential
- **SEO Optimization**: Considers search volume and competition data

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Workflow Design (Week 1)

**Requirements Analysis**

- Analyzed existing content research process
- Identified key data sources (SerpAPI, Google Trends)
- Mapped desired workflow from trend detection to publication
- Designed n8n visual workflow architecture

**Technical Setup**

- Configured SerpAPI for trend monitoring
- Set up OpenAI GPT-4 integration for analysis
- Connected Google Sheets for data management
- Established Slack webhook for notifications

### Phase 2: Core Logic Development (Week 2)

**Trend Processing Pipeline**

```javascript
// Trend data normalization and filtering
function processTrendData(serpApiResults) {
    const relatedQueries = serpApiResults.related_queries || {};
    const candidates = [];

    // Process rising and top queries
    ["rising", "top"].forEach((section) => {
        (relatedQueries[section] || []).forEach((query, index) => {
            candidates.push({
                topic_raw: query.query.trim(),
                trend_score: extractTrendScore(query.value),
                source: `related_queries_${section}`,
                rank: index + 1,
                trend_window: "7 days",
            });
        });
    });

    return candidates.filter(
        (candidate) =>
            isAIRelevant(candidate.topic_raw) && candidate.trend_score > 0
    );
}

// AI relevance checking
function isAIRelevant(topic) {
    const aiKeywords = [
        "ai",
        "artificial intelligence",
        "machine learning",
        "llm",
        "chatgpt",
        "openai",
        "automation",
        "copilot",
        "agent",
    ];

    return aiKeywords.some((keyword) => topic.toLowerCase().includes(keyword));
}
```

**Content Intelligence Layer**

```javascript
// OpenAI integration for topic selection
async function selectTopics(candidates, existingSlugs) {
    const prompt = `
  ${SYSTEM_PROMPT}
  
  Trend Candidates: ${JSON.stringify(candidates)}
  Existing Slugs: ${existingSlugs.join(", ")}
  
  Return JSON with exactly 5 topics:
  {
    "ai_topics": [
      {
        "topic_raw": "original trend query",
        "topic_normalized": "clean title",
        "slug": "url-friendly-slug",
        "score": 85,
        "reason": "why this topic is valuable"
      }
    ]
  }
  `;

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
        response_format: { type: "json_object" },
    });

    return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Automation (Week 3)

**Google Sheets Pipeline**

- Automated row creation for each selected topic
- Status tracking from "new" → "in-progress" → "published"
- Metadata storage (trend scores, sources, selection reasoning)

**Team Notification System**

- Slack alerts for new topic discoveries
- Email notifications for high-priority trends
- Error handling and retry logic for API failures

## The Results

### Content Operations Transformation

### 3. Dynamic Trend Scoring

- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines search volume, growth rate, and relevance
- **Contextual Scoring**: Adjusts scores based on Kalyxi's content focus
- **Threshold Management**: Automatically adjusts quality thresholds

## Key Learnings

1. **Visual Workflows**: n8n's visual interface made the complex logic understandable to non-technical team members

2. **AI Augmentation**: GPT-4 excels at qualitative analysis that's difficult to code with rules

3. **Integration Value**: Connecting existing tools (Sheets, Slack) creates exponential productivity gains

4. **Automation Adoption**: Starting with one painful process (research) built team confidence in automation

5. **Data Quality**: Automated systems require robust error handling and data validation
