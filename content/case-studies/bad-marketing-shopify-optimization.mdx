## Career Evolution: From CRO Developer to Systems Architect

My journey at BAD Marketing began in September 2022 as a Web Developer focused on Shopify CRO, and culminated in a promotion to **Advanced Systems & Operations Developer** in September 2025. This 3+ year partnership showcases not just technical growth, but consistent delivery of business-critical systems that power a high-growth marketing agency.

## Phase 1: CRO Mastery (Sep 2022 - Aug 2025)

    updateVisualElements(themeConfig);
    trackPersonalizationEvent(productHandle);
}
```

## Phase 2: Systems Architecture Evolution (Sep 2025 - Present)

### The Promotion

In September 2025, I was promoted to **Advanced Systems & Operations Developer** - a role created specifically for my unique blend of CRO expertise and systems thinking. I now build the "glue" that powers BAD Marketing's operations at scale.

### Enterprise Systems Built

**1. Modular ETL Platform**
Replaced a 300+ line monolith with production-grade architecture:

```typescript
// Service-oriented ETL architecture
interface ETLService {
    extract(): Promise<DataSource>;
    transform(data: DataSource): Promise<TransformedData>;
    load(data: TransformedData): Promise<LoadResult>;
}

class KlaviyoETLService implements ETLService {
    private rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(1000); // 1 req/sec
    private retryHandler = new ExponentialBackoff();

    async extract(): Promise<KlaviyoData> {
        return this.klaviyoClient.fetchCampaigns({
            dateRange: this.config.dateRange,
            batchSize: 500,
        });
    }

    async transform(data: KlaviyoData): Promise<BigQuerySchema> {
        return this.transformer.standardize(data, {
            timezone: "EST",
            deduplication: true,
            validation: this.schemas.marketing,
        });
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **75% faster development** cycles for new integrations
- **Single-responsibility services** with comprehensive tests
- **Clear interfaces** reducing integration complexity
- **Fewer regressions** through modular testing

**2. Multi-Stage Lead Processing Pipeline**
Built sophisticated n8n automation handling complete lead lifecycle:

```json
{
    "pipeline_stages": [
        {
            "stage": "ingestion",
            "services": ["Google Sheets", "ClickUp", "Manual Upload"],
            "validation": ["email_format", "required_fields", "duplicate_check"]
        },
        {
            "stage": "verification",
            "services": ["ZeroBounce", "MillionVerifier"],
            "scoring": ["deliverability", "quality", "risk_assessment"]
        },
        {
            "stage": "enrichment",
            "services": ["Smartlead", "LinkedIn", "Company Data"],
            "outputs": ["lead_score", "contact_timing", "campaign_fit"]
        },
        {
            "stage": "distribution",
            "services": [
                "Campaign Auto-Creation",
                "Slack Notifications",
                "ClickUp Updates"
            ],
            "tracking": ["audit_trail", "performance_metrics", "attribution"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**3. Sales Call Review AI Agent**
Built intelligent transcript processing system:

```typescript
interface CallAnalysis {
    transcript_chunks: TranscriptChunk[];
    structured_feedback: {
        strengths: string[];
        improvement_areas: string[];
        action_items: ActionItem[];
        coaching_resources: Resource[];
    };
    team_summary: SlackMessage;
}

class CallReviewAgent {
    async processCall(transcript: string): Promise<CallAnalysis> {
        const chunks = await this.chunkTranscript(transcript);
        const analysis = await this.analyzeWithGPT4(chunks);

        // Post concise summary to team Slack
        await this.slackClient.postMessage({
            channel: "#sales-team",
            text: this.formatTeamSummary(analysis),
        });

        return analysis;
    }
}
```

### Production Infrastructure Excellence

const trackingContract = {
    required_events: [
        "page_view",
        "add_to_cart",
        "purchase",
        "lead_generated",
        "email_signup",
    ],
    custom_parameters: {
        client_id: "string",
        campaign_source: "string",
        attribution_model: "5_day_click_1_day_view",
    },
    validation_rules: {
        revenue_attribution: "must_match_shopify",

        const startTime = Date.now();

        try {
            const campaigns = await this.extractCampaigns(client);
            const flows = await this.extractFlows(client);
            const transformed = await this.transformData([
                ...campaigns,
                ...flows,
            ]);
            const loaded = await this.loadToBigQuery(transformed);

            await this.monitoring.recordSuccess({
                client: client.name,
                recordsProcessed: loaded.count,
                duration: Date.now() - startTime,
            });

            return { success: true, recordsProcessed: loaded.count };
        } catch (error) {
            await this.alerting.sendCriticalAlert({
                service: "ETL",
                client: client.name,
                error: error.message,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            });

            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```
