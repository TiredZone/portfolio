## The Challenge

Kalyxi, an AI-focused content and lead generation company, was struggling with manual processes across their core operations. Their team was spending excessive time on repetitive tasks that could be automated, creating bottlenecks that limited their ability to scale effectively.

### Operational Pain Points

- **Content Operations**: Manual topic research and content pipeline management
- **Lead Processing**: Inconsistent data quality and time-intensive validation
- **Sales Analysis**: No systematic call review or coaching feedback
- **Resource Allocation**: Teams focused on repetitive tasks instead of strategic work
- **Scalability**: Manual processes couldn't handle business growth

## The Solution

I designed and implemented a comprehensive automation transformation using three interconnected n8n workflows that addressed each core operational area:

### 1. [SEO Content Generation Pipeline](/work/kalyxi-content-automation)

**Automated AI-driven content creation workflow**

Transformed Kalyxi's content operations from 4+ hours weekly of manual research to a fully automated system that:

- Monitors AI trends using SerpAPI
- Analyzes and selects 5 optimal topics weekly using OpenAI GPT-4
- Manages content pipeline through Google Sheets integration
- Coordinates team activities via Slack notifications

**Key Results:** 95% time reduction in topic research, consistent AI-focused content pipeline

### 2. [Lead Cleaning & Validation System](/work/kalyxi-lead-processing)

**Intelligent lead processing and data enhancement**

Revolutionized lead data quality through a hybrid approach combining rule-based processing with AI enhancement:

- Validates emails using ZeroBounce API with 95% accuracy
- Normalizes and standardizes lead data automatically
- Applies intelligent scoring for lead prioritization
- Reduces manual review requirements by 70%

**Key Results:** 80% data quality improvement, 15-minute processing vs. 2-3 hours manual

### 3. [Sales Call Analysis System](/work/kalyxi-sales-analysis)

**AI-powered sales coaching and performance analysis**

Automated comprehensive sales call analysis providing instant, structured feedback:

- Processes call transcripts from Fathom automatically
- Generates detailed coaching feedback using OpenAI GPT-4
- Integrates training resources from Google Docs and YouTube
- Delivers actionable insights immediately via Slack

**Key Results:** 100% call coverage, instant feedback vs. days-delayed manual review

## Technical Architecture

Goal:
Pick EXACTLY 5 NEW blog topics from trend candidates.
- Prefer highest 'trend_score'
- Must be clearly about AI (LLMs, agents, copilots, regulation/safety)
- Exclude generic definitions, celebrity names, non-AI queries
- Do NOT return any topic whose kebab-case slug already appears in existing_slugs
- If fewer than 5 remain, CREATE new topics inspired by trending themes
`;

// n8n workflow components:
// 1. Schedule Trigger (weekly automation)
// 2. SerpAPI trend monitoring for "AI" keyword
// 3. Google Sheets integration for existing content tracking

    // Normalize lead data with proper case handling
    const cleanLead = {
        email: sanitizeEmail(rawLead.email),
        firstName: properCase(rawLead.firstName),
        lastName: properCase(rawLead.lastName),
        company: cleanCompanyName(rawLead.company),
        title: normalizeJobTitle(rawLead.title),
    };

    // Calculate quality score based on multiple factors
    const qualityScore = calculateLeadScore({
        emailValidity: validateEmailFormat(cleanLead.email),
        dataCompleteness: calculateCompleteness(cleanLead),
        businessRelevance: assessBusinessRelevance(
            cleanLead.company,
            cleanLead.title
        ),

        // Check Redis cache first
        const cached = await redis.get(`lead:${email}`);
        if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

        // Check database
        const lead = await db.lead.findUnique({
            where: { email },
        });

        if (lead) {
            // Cache for 1 hour
            await redis.setex(`lead:${email}`, 3600, JSON.stringify(lead));
        }

        return lead;

### Phase 3: SmartLead Integration (Weeks 5-6)

**Campaign Automation**

```typescript
// SmartLead campaign management
export class CampaignManager {
    private smartLead: SmartLeadClient;

    async createCampaign(
        leads: Lead[],
        template: EmailTemplate
    ): Promise<Campaign> {
        // Filter valid leads
        const validLeads = leads.filter((l) => l.validationStatus === "valid");

        // Segment by score
        const segments = this.segmentLeads(validLeads);

        // Create personalized campaigns for each segment
        const campaigns = await Promise.all(
            Object.entries(segments).map(([segment, leads]) =>
                this.createSegmentCampaign(
                    segment as LeadSegment,
                    leads,
                    template
                )
            )
        );

        return {
            id: generateId(),
            segments: campaigns,
            totalLeads: validLeads.length,
            status: "active",
        };
    }

    private async createSegmentCampaign(
        segment: LeadSegment,
        leads: Lead[],
        template: EmailTemplate
    ): Promise<SegmentCampaign> {
        // Customize template for segment
        const customizedTemplate = this.customizeTemplate(template, segment);

        // Upload leads to SmartLead
        const campaign = await this.smartLead.campaigns.create({
            name: `${template.name} - ${segment}`,
            leads: leads.map((l) => ({
                email: l.email,
                firstName: l.firstName,
                lastName: l.lastName,
                company: l.company,
                customFields: {
                    title: l.title,
                    score: l.score.score,
                },
            })),
            template: customizedTemplate,
            settings: this.getCampaignSettings(segment),
        });

        return campaign;
    }

    private getCampaignSettings(segment: LeadSegment): CampaignSettings {
        // Adjust sending strategy based on segment
        switch (segment) {
            case "hot":
                return {
                    dailyLimit: 50,
                    delayBetweenEmails: 60, // 1 minute
                    followUpSequence: [1, 3, 7], // Days
                    maxFollowUps: 3,
                };
            case "warm":
                return {
                    dailyLimit: 100,
                    delayBetweenEmails: 120, // 2 minutes
                    followUpSequence: [2, 5, 10],
                    maxFollowUps: 2,
                };
            default:
                return {
                    dailyLimit: 200,
                    delayBetweenEmails: 300, // 5 minutes
                    followUpSequence: [3, 7],
                    maxFollowUps: 1,
                };
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Optimization (Ongoing)
