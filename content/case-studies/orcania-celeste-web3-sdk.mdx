## The Web3 Infrastructure Challenge

At Orcania, we were building multiple decentralized applications but found ourselves repeatedly implementing the same Web3 wallet connection logic, smart contract interactions, and state management across projects. Each DApp required wallet integration, multi-chain support, and complex blockchain state management. This led to code duplication, inconsistent user experiences, and slower development cycles.

## Engineering the Solution: Celeste-JS SDK

I architected and developed **Celeste-JS**, a comprehensive Web3 SDK that standardized blockchain interactions across all Orcania projects. The solution consisted of four core packages in a Lerna monorepo:

### **Core Architecture (@celeste-js/core)**

The foundation package provided the main CelesteJS class with sophisticated wallet and chain management:

```javascript
import CelesteJS from "@celeste-js/core";

const celeste = new CelesteJS({
    isMultichain: true,
    rpcs: {
        ETH: {
            chainId: "1",
            url: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY",
        },
        BOBA: {
            chainId: "288",
            url: "https://mainnet.boba.network",
        },
    },
    smartContracts: [
        {
            key: "DEX",
            abi: DEX_ABI,
            address: {
                1: "0x...", // Ethereum address
                288: "0x...", // Boba address
            },
        },
    ],
});
```

**Key Technical Features:**

- **Multi-chain Provider Management**: Automatically handled provider switching between networks
- **Smart Contract Abstraction**: Single interface for contracts deployed across multiple chains
- **Session Persistence**: Maintained wallet connections across page reloads
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event handling for account/chain changes

### **React Integration (@celeste-js/react)**

Built React hooks and components for seamless DApp integration:

```javascript
import { useCeleste, ConnectedWrapper } from "@celeste-js/react";

function MyDApp() {
    const { requestConnection, isConnected } = useCeleste();

    return (
        <ConnectedWrapper>
            <DEXInterface />
        </ConnectedWrapper>
    );
}
```

**React Components Included:**

- `CelesteProvider`: Context provider for wallet state
- `ConnectedWrapper`: Conditional rendering based on connection status
- `ConnectButton`: Standardized wallet connection interface
- `NetworkWrapper`: Chain-specific component rendering
- `SwitchNetworkButton`: One-click network switching

### **State Management (@celeste-js/store)**

Implemented Redux-based state management for complex blockchain data:

```javascript
import { store, useCelesteSelector } from "@celeste-js/store";

const WalletInfo = () => {
    const { address, chainId, isConnected } = useCelesteSelector(
        (state) => state.walletReducer
    );

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Address: {address}</p>
            <p>Chain: {chainId}</p>
            <p>Status: {isConnected ? "Connected" : "Disconnected"}</p>
        </div>
    );
};
```

### **CLI Tools (@celeste-js/cli)**

Developed command-line utilities for contract deployment and configuration management.

## Real-World Implementation

### **Orcania DEX Integration**

The DEX utilized Celeste-JS for multi-chain token trading:

```javascript
// celeste.config.js - DEX Configuration
module.exports = {
    isMultichain: true,
    rpcs: {
        ETH: { chainId: "4", url: "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/..." },
        BOBA: { chainId: "28", url: "https://rinkeby.boba.network" },
    },
    smartContracts: [
        {
            key: "DEX",
            abi: DEX_ABI,
            address: {
                28: "0xCdE8C10eE7067Ff50f911d74883130D2799FF35c",
                4: "0x6f4d72B17bFa9b77269b9cd732dDe84f158AfacD",
            },
        },
    ],
};
```

The DEX handled complex trading operations across Ethereum and Boba networks with automatic provider switching and transaction management.

## Technical Innovations

### **1. Provider Proxy Pattern**

Implemented a provider proxy that abstracted wallet differences:

```javascript
class ProviderProxy {
    setType(providerType) {
        this.currentProvider = this.getProvider(providerType);
    }

    async requestConnection() {
        // Unified connection logic for MetaMask & WalletConnect
    }

    async requestChangeNetwork(chainId) {
        // Standardized network switching
    }
}
```

### **2. Smart Contract Factory System**

Created a factory pattern for multi-chain contract instances:

```javascript
const initSC = (address, config, web3, suffix) => {
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(config.abi, address);
    // Register contract with read/write capabilities
    celesteStore.dispatch(addSmartContract(`${config.key}${suffix}`, contract));
};
```

### **3. Event-Driven Architecture**

Built comprehensive event handling for blockchain state changes:

```javascript
celeste.on("accountsChanged", (accounts) => {
    // Handle wallet account changes
});

celeste.on("chainChanged", (chainId) => {
    // Handle network switches
    updateContractInstances(chainId);
});
```

## Production Impact
